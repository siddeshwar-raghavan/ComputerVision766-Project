## SpaceNet - 6, extracting building footprints from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
## Siddeshwar Raghavan and Neel Kelkar 

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a unique form of radar that can penetrate clouds, collect images during all- weather conditions, and capture data during day and night. Overhead collects from SAR satellites could be particularly valuable in the quest to aid disaster response in instances where weather and cloud cover can obstruct traditional Electro-Optical (EO) sensors. However, despite these advantages, there is limited open data available to researchers to explore the effectiveness of SAR for such applications, particularly at ultra-high resolutions.

We focus on the problem to automatically extract building footprints with computer vision and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms from SAR imagery datasets, but trained on a combination of SAR and Electro-Optical image datasets. This is based on the competition - SpaceNet 6 that was hosted in Mar 2020.
